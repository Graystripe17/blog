I have a tendency to see nails when I learn how to use a new hammer.
I will find an idea that's being floated around on social media, and then view everyday occurences through the lense of that idea.

The problem is that I don't properly apply these ideas and end up forgetting about them in a few months.
I want to have a space to build arguments for these ideas, and test if they hold up overtime.
This blog will force me to "serialize" any thoughts I have into plain English, archive them on Github, and in the future I can unpickle them as needed.
